== Description ==

TwoColCats is a simple Wordpress Plugin.

It provides a Wordpress Widget that displays the list of categories in
two or more columns in your sidebar. Use it instead of the built-in categories
widget.

It displays only the level-1 categories.


== Installation ==

1. Download twocolcats-wp-plugin.zip and unzip into the
  `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. From the Wordpress admin backend, Activate the plugin through the
   'Plugins' menu

3. From the Wordpress admin backend, in the Widgets menu, drag-and-drop
   the widget to your sidebar.  You can place it in any position you
   like.

4. Specify the settings for the widget:
   Title, number of columns, margins, and whether to include post
   counts.

That's it !
